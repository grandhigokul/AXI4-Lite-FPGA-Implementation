# AXI4-Lite-FPGA-Implementation

This repository contains the AXI4-Lite interface implementation on an FPGA, specifically targeting the Zynq-7000 series. The project includes an AXI4-Lite Master and Slave design, integrated with VIO (Virtual Input/Output) and ILA (Integrated Logic Analyzer) for debugging and testing.

## Key Features:
AXI4-Lite Master & Slave: Designed for efficient data transfer.
Internal Clock Generation: Implemented using MMCM/PLL, avoiding external clock dependency.
VIO Integration: Allows real-time input control for read/write operations.
ILA Debugging: Captures key AXI4-Lite signals, including handshaking, address, data, and responses.
No External Pins (Except Reset): The design is fully self-contained within the FPGA.
Standalone Top Module: Integrates AXI4-Lite Master, Slave, VIO, ILA, and Clocking IPs without requiring a wrapper module.
Signal Integrity: Ensures no signal drives multiple loads, maintaining correct AXI4-Lite protocol operation.

## Implementation Details:
Developed using Vivado and tested on Zynq-7000 FPGA.
Verified functional correctness via VIO-controlled testing and ILA signal monitoring.
Designed for easy integration into larger FPGA-based AXI systems.

## Future Scope:
Verification using SystemVerilog OOP-based testbenches.
Enhancements for multi-slave support and performance optimization.
